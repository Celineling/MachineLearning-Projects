# Project-Done
Projects about machine learning methods by python3
### FaceBook Online Bid Bot Detection(70MB)                            
Built Logistic Regression (LR) and Naive Bayes (NB) models to predict a new bidder is bot or a human.
Evaluated models’ performances using Log Loss Evaluation, ROC curve and Precision-recall curve, which indicated the LR model was better than the NB model.

### Destinations Prediction for Uses’ Hotel Reservation (631MB)
Built Single Decision Tree, Random Forest and Ada-boosting Tree to make prediction. By tracking the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), the accuracy rate increased by 11-23%, which could increase user engagement.

### Movie Recommender System for MovieLens (3MB)
Built 3 different Collaborative Filtering models of recommender system using Unsupervised Learning methods.<br>
Centered Cosine Similarity based method, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method and Funk SVD method (100 iterations in Gradient Decent process)<br>
Calculated the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) and compared the top 10 predicted and actual favorite movies for a certain user. The numbers of correctly predicted were 3, 6 and 7, respectively.


### NBA 2018 Champion Prediction
Built Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression models. Used K-fold Cross Validation to compare the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which indicated the Lasso model was the best.<br>
Made prediction using Lasso Regression model. Used ranking table and scatter plot to compare the predicted results with the real
results. The accuracy is 70%, and the real champion was predicted the 2nd.
